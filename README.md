# API-Channel

The Xenioo API Channel allows any application capable of making simple RESTful https calls to integrate and interact with a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.xenioo.com'>Xenioo</a> chatbot. 

Using the Xenioo API Channel you will be controlling the way the conversation will be displayed to the user as well as <a target='_blank' href='https://www.xenioo.com/changing-conversation-flow/'>being able to change runtime variables</a> anytime.

In this repository you can find two simple C# examples of chatbot interaction as well as a python implementation of a shell based chatbot. All of the samples connect to a Xenioo demo chatbot that is always online. To implement your own chatbot you just need to signup for a free account on <a target='_blank' href='https://app.xenioo.com/auth/signup'Xenioo</a>.
